Software pipeline:

Indexing 

BAM files are converted to FASTQ files using bam2fastq, and run through
sga prepreprocess, in paired-end mode (--pe-mode 2).

FM indices indices are generated from the FASTQ files using sga index -a
ropebwt --no-reverse --no-sai, and SAI indices generated using sga gen-ssa
--sai-only.

SGA calls

SGA graph difference calls are made with sga graph-diff, with parameters
--min-dbg-count 2 -k 55 -x 4 -a debruijn.

Freebayes calls

Thirteen samples (listed at end) used the same read group name for both the
normal and tumour samples, which freebayes can't handle.  For those samples,
bamaddrg was used to stream the BAMS, replace the RGs, and stream directly into
FB with 

`bamaddrg -b $(VARIANT_BAM) -c -s $(VARIANT_SAMPLE_NAME) -r variant -b $(BASE_BAM) -s $(BASE_SAMPLE_NAME) -r base`.

In the remaining fifty cases, freebayes read directly from the BAM files.  In
either case, the options used to generate somatic calls with Freebayes were:

--pooled-discrete --pooled-continuous --min-alternate-fraction 0.1 --allele-balance-priors-off --genotype-qualities 

and multiple freebayes jobs were run at once, one per chromosome (run using, eg, -r X).

The per-chromosome freebayes runs were then combined (using vcflib's
vcfcombine), multiallelic calls were split (using vcflib's vcfbreakmulti), and
tagged by somatic status (using vcflib's vcfsamplediff).  Awk was used
to pull out only the somatic calls, filtering out variants on unplaced
chromosomes or those on mitocondrial DNA.  A similar filtering was done 
of germline calls, requiring them to be mapped to chromosomes but also
requiring a quality score of at least 5.

Graph Concordance

The freebayes calls were tested for consistency with the SGA string graph using
both a deterministic and a probabilistic method.

In each case, sga graph-concordance was run against the freebayes somatic and
germline callsets, and used the BWT and SAI indices of the fastq files.  The
results were leftaligned and normalized (using bcftools norm) and again
variants on unplaced contigs were removed.  Using sga-dbsnp-filter, calls
that were in dbSNP but were not in COSMIC were removed.  

The filtered freebayes calls were then run through sga-somatic-variant-filters
with --min-var-dp 4 --min-af 0.1, and meregd with the SGA-only calls using
sga_freebayes_merge.pl --nograph_concordance and --min-quality=30 for the
original graph concordance and 20 for the probabilistic model.  Sites with
anything other than PASS in the FILTER record were stripped out with awk.

The outputs from the earlier and newer graph-concordance steps were sorted with
vcfsort, bgziped, and indexed, and then merged with bcftools merge.  Separate
indel and snv_mnv submission files were made with vcflibs' vcfindels and awk
(testing to see if the REF and ALT records were the same length).
